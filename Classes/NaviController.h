/**
    NaviController is a tree based view controller container.
    Requires: ios target >= 5.0
 
- Why use:
    . Make complicated view controller's switch simple (Push,Pop,PopTo,Jump)
    . Enable push a view controller as many time as you like.
      You can choose to push it as a new VC or as a REF by setting identifier.
    . Make custom view transition animations easily.
    . Android style's view controller's communication(such as value pass and call back).
      Say goodbye to custom init and Delegate callbacks.
 
    NaviController provide 3 types of ViewController's transition:
    . PUSH : push a view controller(new or referrence) will add a node to current navigationTree. Push a view controller several times is allowed.
    . JUMP : jump to a exsiting vc. Jump do not add node to navigation tree, it simply moves current node to jump target.
    . POP  : pop to a target will cause navigation tree release subnode under target vc.
 
 
- ViewController's identifier
    A unique identifier is added to view controller when you push a view controller with no identifier specified. So you can always leave identifier nil. But identifier is a recommended way to identify view controller instead of VC instance variables. You can define identifier & viewcontroller's name in a global header file. Create viewcontroller using NSClassFromString. Reference viewcontroller using identifier. You can set identifier='view controller name' when this view controller is a singleton instance. This is a good way to sperate class implemetion and classes' interactions.
 
- Handel ViewController's Callback
        Usually we use a VC to push other VCs to finish a job. When those VCs finish this job, you'll want to notify the job owner and let owner handle all these stuffs.
    . Send a callback : A response should be send when you finish a job, and let parent controller do the dismiss job.
                        Use 'sendResponseWithResultCode' to send a response to parent controllers who want recieve this message.
                        callback will pass from parent controller to root controller until some one catches this callback.
    . Receive callback: A VC should implement method "didReceiveResponseFromViewController" to handle event from sub controllers.
                        This method has a return value of which YES means it can handle this callback and NO to continue pass on callback to parent controller.
